# Vista App

This project is a fork of the [ALCOM(vrc-get-gui)](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get/tree/master/vrc-get-gui) section of the [vrc-get](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get) project and is not an official part of [vrc-get](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get).

Please report issues and suggestions directly to us. Do not use the official support channels.

## Why?

ALCOM's UI is built using Next.js. Compared to frameworks like Next.js, I prefer the flexibility of Vite. Thus, this project was bornâ€”an implementation using Vite+Vue.

The name "Vista" was chosen to clearly differentiate this project from the original vrc-get project.

Currently, this project will only make modifications to the UI part. The Tauri(Rust) component will remain consistent with ALCOM.

## Roadmap
